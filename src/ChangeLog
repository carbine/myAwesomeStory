	todo:
	standardize state/reward function

	created Road/Intersect classes. haven't done much in the way of
	using them

	* Main.java: no longer manages half of LearnerModuleImpl's
	    implementation -- yay!

	Updating a bunch of interfaces; hopefully reduce the complexity
	sufficiently that variable lanes, turning traffic, etc can be
	implemented reasonably easily.

	* interfaces/Car.java: 
	    - merged updateVelocity and updatePosition into move
	    - removed stopped and getChar

	* Makefile: now uses restored package heirarchy

	* Main.java: minor changes; can pass RL parameters in as arguments
	* interfaces/LearningModule.java: ""
	* LearningModuleImpl.java: "". Also reformatted the code and some
	    logic here and there. While some design aspects remain
	    questionable I change it further due to time constraints.
	    Unless something is suggested.

	* CarImpl.java: stopped() now returns whether the car has zero
	   velocity (rather than zero position).
	* Main.java: now evaluates the success of the learning algorithm.

    *updated to have 4 traffic lights. this required some reworking of
