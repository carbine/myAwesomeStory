	todo:
	standardize state/reward function

	created Road/Intersect classes. haven't done much in the way of
	using them

	* Main.java: no longer manages half of LearnerModuleImpl's
	    implementation -- yay!

	Updating a bunch of interfaces; hopefully reduce the complexity
	sufficiently that variable lanes, turning traffic, etc can be
	implemented reasonably easily.
